Introduction

This project is a web application designed to assist users in managing their diet and nutrition plans. The project is built using PHP and the Laravel framework. It provides a wide food dataset and uses scientific methods to calculate the basal metabolic rate (BMR), enabling the creation of personalized diet profiles.

Features

Database Management: Integrated with SQL database using four main tables: foods, users, user_diet_profiles, and user_menus.
Food Dataset: A comprehensive dataset with over 7500 foods and recipes.
BMR Calculator: Allows users to calculate their daily calorie needs by entering their gender, age, height, weight, and daily activity level.
Diet Profile Creation: Users can create personalized diet profiles and meal plans.
Three Meal Planning: Foods are categorized into breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
Alert System: Warns users if their selected meals exceed their daily calorie needs calculated by the BMR calculator.
Admin Panel: Advanced management features for user and food management.

User Types

User: Can perform basic operations like creating diet profiles, meal planning, and BMR calculation.

Admin: Has additional privileges such as user and food management, deleting and editing user accounts, and adding new food items.

Next Steps
